# zkp-client

This is a client utilizing a zero knowledge proof service [zkp-service](https://github.com/hack-2023/zkp-service/)<br/>
It a basic authentication flow using clients email/password for login, the difference being:
- The client never shares the password with the service (only the email & hash is registered with the service)
- The client never uses the password or the hash for login
- The service challenges the client (at the moment) with sending SHA3-256 hash for some characters from the stored hash
- The number of challenges is generated by the service and is completely random (>50 atm)
- The number of characters to be hashed in each challenge is also random (> length of hash/2 atm)
- The flow cannot be completed in a browser atm and thats why this special client
- AI completeting these challenges (which should be random in the future) would make it more robust as a client is usually a static logic ðŸ¤”
